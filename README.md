# ATE Software Framework

## Objective
Automated test systems may be with a DAQ module or a stand-alone controller, but they typically require a mix of off-the-shelf and custom hardware. All that hardware is integrated and wired into a bench-top rack. To manage ATE instrumentation efficiently, it is nessesary to design a scalable, ***modular architecture programmed typically with LabVIEW***. The architecture will be distributed to a team of developers to work on one or multiple modules. Each module have all of the instructions for the developer to complete the development and integration into the main project.
